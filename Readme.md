# Gramener Playground - Files and Datasets from my interview

### The interview process for the position of an Intern at Gramener

This repository essential contains the questions, public dataset and the solutions to the questions asked at the interview process. I would love to run you through the process, but the experience, that is something I would keep to myself. Hope this helps you in preparing for your interview for this company or any other Data Science company.


## The Trial

The interview process was fairly straight-forward. They started off as soon as the clock hit 11(the interview was proposed to be between 11am-1pm) and gave us 30 minutes to solve two questions. We were provided with the link to a github repository that housed the data set(which you wouldnt need to venture since I have already included the necessary file). The following questions were what we were expected to answer : 

1.) Given a state and a year, which candidate has the maximum number of votes and which candidate has the minimum.

2.) Given a state, which party is the most dominant.

**Dataset : Assembly.csv**

After this, we had a good 30-45 minute discussion about my approaches and a few questions about my previous projects.

## To view the solution you are required to `run` the following commands :

```python
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```python
	jupyter notebook
```

After this, run your local host and open the `Solutions.ipynb` Jupyter Notebok to go through the solution.
